'''Instructions
Compute the price of a meal as follows by asking for the price of child and 
adult meals, the number of each, and then the sales tax rate. Use these values 
to determine the total price of the meal. Then, ask for the payment amount and compute the 
amount of change to give back to the customer.

Keep in mind that some of these values are floating point numbers (they can have decimals) and some of them are integers (whole numbers).

Ask the user for the following:

-The price of a child's meal (floating point)

-The price of an adult's meal (floating point)

-The number of children (integer)

-The number of adults (integer)

-Then, complete the following steps:

-Determine the meal's subtotal (before adding sales tax) by multiplying the number of children 
by the price of their meal, and multiplying the number of adults by the price of their meal and 
adding those two values together.

Hint from Instructor:
As you will see in the requirements list below, this is all that is needed for the milestone requirements in 
the middle of the week, but you should try to get as far as you can to make it even easier for yourself to finish 
the week, especially if you run into trouble.

Ask the user for the sales tax rate as a percentage (floating point). Please note that thispercentage should be 
entered and stored as a number such as 6, or 6.5, not 0.06 or 0.065.

Compute and display the sales tax, by multiplying the subtotal by the sales tax rate divided by 100.

Compute and display the total price of the meal by adding the subtotal and the sales tax. '''
